# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Weather App Description

The app fetches the user's current location data using an api call to the https://geolocation-db.com/json/ free location data provider.
Then, the app uses the user's current location data to make another API call to openweathermap to fetch the current weather data for the user's current location.
The weather data is then displayed in the UI in this single page react application. All the temperatures are returned in kelvin unit from the openweathermap API JSON response.
The app then converts the temperatures to fahrenheit to make it look more user-friendly. The app was tested in multiple browsers e.g. chrome, safari etc. and it's responsive across brwosers and the mobile UIs. The app was built using creact-react-app and react version 17.0.2. And, the instructions for running the app are described above.

The app has two main react components:

1. `WeatherDataContainer`
2. `DailyWeatherData`

`WeatherDataContainer` component is responsible for making the API calls and fetching JSON data from 2 different APIs (location and weather data).
`DailyWeatherData` component is responsible for displaying the weather data in the UI and is used inside the `WeatherDataContainer` component.
`weatherData` and `locaton` are fetched from the APIs and are passed as props to the `DailyWeatherData` component which then uses those data and displays them in the UI.
